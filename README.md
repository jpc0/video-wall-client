## Required Packages

Please make sure the following packages are installed on your system:
- Boost (at least version 1.67)
- ZeroMQ
- SDL2

Reasonable recent source files for these packages are included in the vendor
folder if you need to build them from source however it is strongly recommended
that you use the package manager bundled with your distro on Linux, the 
official binaries for windows or homebrew for Mac.
